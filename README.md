DiAtomic is an open-source library written in Python with useful routines for performing various computations of diatomic molecules.

-------

Its main functionality includes:

- energy eigenvalues computation for single noninteracting electronic state
and for a system of arbitrary number of states coupled by large number of possible interactions

- calculations of transition frequencies and intensities

- fitting of the computed energy levels to the experimental data
