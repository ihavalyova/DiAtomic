# Diatom
<!-- **Diatom** (**Diatom**-ic) is a Python package implementing useful routines for various computations of Diatomic Molecules using OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) style. 

-------

The main features and functionalities of **Diatom** include:

- energy eigenvalues computation of a single and noninteracting molecular state

- energy eigenvalues computation of system of arbitrary number of interacting states coupled by an arbitrary number of possible interactions
   
- Transition frequencies and intensity calculations 

- Diatomic Spectra simulations

- *convinient, intuitive and very easy to use* -->
