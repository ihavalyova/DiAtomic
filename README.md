DiAtomic is an open-source library written in Python with useful routines for performing various computations of diatomic molecules. It supports object-oriented approach with easy to use functionality and efficiently vectorized code. It can be used to:
- compute the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors (by solving the radial Schrodinger equation) for
  - single non-interacting electronic state
  - system of arbitrary number of coupled electronic states

- compute the transition frequencies when either PECs or term values are available
- fit of the computed energy levels to the experimental data

**To install**: call Python pip from the command line:

```pip install diatomic-computations```
