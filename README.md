DiAtomic is an open-source Python library that contains useful routines for performing various diatomic molecule computations. It supports an object-oriented approach providing simple functionality and efficiently vectorized code. It can be used to:
- compute the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors (by solving the radial Schrodinger equation) for a single electronic state or arbitrary number of coupled states
- compute the transition frequencies when either PECs or term values are available
- fit of the computed energy levels to the experimental data

**To install**: call Python pip from the command line:

```pip install diatomic-computations```
