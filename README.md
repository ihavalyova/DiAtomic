DiAtomic is an open-source library written in Python with useful routines for performing various computations of diatomic molecules.

-------

Its main functionality includes:

- energy eigenvalues computation for single noninteracting electronic state
and for a system of arbitrary number of coupled states

- computing the transition frequencies and line intensities

- fitting of the computed energy levels to the experimental data
